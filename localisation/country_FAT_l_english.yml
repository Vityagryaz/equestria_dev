 FAT_new_airforce_desc:0 "Only a few of the most powerful countries on the Griffonian continent have Air Forces, we should do our best to join them in that. Having machines fly in the skies and attack enemies below, or keeping superiority in air is a relatively new concept, but it is one of these concepts that can truly change the way wars are fought, and we cannot let ourselves stay behind in such a department."
 FAT_fighter_focus:0 "Rule the Skies"
 FAT_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The most important part of air warfare is to have control over the skies, and as such, we should focus our efforts on creating planes that would let us do that. Our planes should be relatively small and agile, so our pilots could take out enemy bombers and fighters, while staying safe themselves."
 FAT_bomber_focus:0 "Death From Above"
 FAT_bomber_focus_desc:0 "The biggest premise of this new air warfare is killing as much of the enemy troops on the ground as it is possible without engaging them with our own ground forces. We should focus on creating planes that could carry as many bombs as it is possible, and that would let us strike the enemy positions no matter far how away they could be from our own troopers."
 FAT_air_doctrine:0 "Seek Foreign Experts Help"
 FAT_air_doctrine_desc:0 "Seeing how we lack our own pilots, we should focus our attention on establishing contacts with veterans from other nations. If we would give enough of our funds to such pilots, they probably would be very excited to work with us, and we could make them share their experience about air tactics and strategy, and maybe they would even lend their service as officers to us."
 FAT_new_bombers:0 "Acquire New Bomber Blueprints"
 FAT_new_bombers_desc:0 "Foreign Pilots that have come to us from other countries sometimes brought something additional other than knowledge with them. If we would splice everything together... we might be able to get working blueprints. and while yes, design of the frame is stolen from the Trade Federation, and their wings still bear Wingbardian markings, but these bombers will be the most modern in whole Griffonia."
 FAT_new_fighters:0 "Commission New Fighters"
 FAT_new_fighters_desc:0 "Thanks to new cadre of officers, our pilots are probably some of the best on the griffonian continent. But, our current fighters aren't the best designs around. If we would establish an initiative that would survey our pilots about their opinion on the upsides and downsides of our current fighters, we could somewhat correct current flaws, and hopefully let our pilots perform even better than they do now."
 FAT_grand_1:0 "Be Ready For Everything"
 FAT_grand_1_desc:0 "We need to plan every attack, every defense, every retreat, and every advance. We need to change our army into something reminiscent of a clockwork. Where every action is planned, discussed and realized after everyone is sure that this is a proper course of action."
 FAT_grand_2:0 "Fortify Our Positions"
 FAT_grand_2_desc:0 "To make sure our units are able to follow our meticulous orders; we need to make sure they will keep their positions. As such, we should focus on adding specialized units whose main task would be fortification of areas that our troops are currently occupying. Besides, using such educated troopers could be very useful, as they would would make it more likely for us to get intel from enemy radio frequences."
 FAT_grand_3:0 "Reshuffle Our HQ"
 FAT_grand_3_desc:0 "Our recent changes in our army has as of now mostly took care of our top commanders, and our units. But we haven't done anything about most of our HQ, or about less important generals. Today, this will change, as we will make sure every one of them will follow our doctrine of excessive planning now."
 FAT_grand_4:0 "Perfect Organization"
 FAT_grand_4_desc:0 "Truly, our army now, as we finalize our reforms isn't in the same sorry state as before. Now it functions as a well oiled machine would. It goes to such a degree, that if we would want, we could even keep track of every single shot fired by out troopers at the enemies, and where it hit, and even when."
 FAT_superior_1:0 "Let's Drown Enemy in The Shells"
 FAT_superior_1_desc:0 "Why waste lives of our citizens, and ability to think independently of our commanders, if we could just throw hundreds, if not thousands of artillery shells at the enemy?"
 FAT_superior_2:0 "Bring Order Into Our Army"
 FAT_superior_2_desc:0 "Our army isn't the most... disciplined bunch, and it goes to a such worrying degree, that using large amounts of artillery now could cause the risk striking some of our bolder troopers. As such, we should focus on introducing special detachments to our units, that will make sure that every of our soldiers will act like they should."
 FAT_superior_3:0 "Dedicated Artilery Units"
 FAT_superior_3_desc:0 "Now that we are sure that artillery fire won't end in massive casualties on our side, we should give our divisions special small detachments of dedicated artillery guns and their crew, so our units can always crack even the most fortified enemy position."
 FAT_superior_4:0 "Creeping Barrages"
 FAT_superior_4_desc:0 "Now that we have enough artillery guns, there is a new tactic available for us. We could cover the assault of our soldiers with artillery fire, and drive the enemy out of their positions, or even just trap entire enemy units in a tight circle of artillery fire."
 FAT_mass_1:0 "Every Citizen Will Be a Soldier"
 FAT_mass_1_desc:0 "We don't have to commission millions of shells, or to force our commanders to adhere to some idiotic protocols. Instead we can just do what always has been done, what has always worked, and now has the potential to be stronger than ever..."
 FAT_mass_2:0 "Convince Militias To Join"
 FAT_mass_2_desc:0 "There are many more or less loyal militias roaming our country. If we would get in contact with their leaders, and hopefully offer them amnesty, riches, or just promise to grant them some enemy to shoot at, we maybe could get many of these militias to join our army as the backbone of few new units."
 FAT_mass_3:0 "Amnesty Program"
 FAT_mass_3_desc:0 "Now instead of offering amnesty only to leaders and officers, we will offer it to every Griffon who has ever fought against us. This will surely help with our manpower."
 FAT_mass_4:0 "Redemption in Death"
 FAT_mass_4_desc:0 "We could extend our Amnesty Program to every prisoner in our country, POW, terrible criminal, or just a common thief, no matter. We will give them all the chance to redeem whatever crimes they have committed, if they will agree on fighting in our ranks."
 FAT_marshal_rifle:0 "Sensible Gun Laws"
 FAT_marshal_rifle_desc:0 "If there is ample amount of something in our country, it would be guns. From all the conflicts that took place recently, and also because of the increased militarization in general, it isn’t even that hard to find places with unguarded and uncared for stockpiles of them. If we would finally start gathering them back, they could be very useful for our army, even if first we would have to convert them all to same parameters."
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quality:0 "Use Our Experience To Create Better Guns"
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quality_desc:0 "All that we had learned while converting, fixing, modifying, and changing all guns that we could get our talons all proved quite valuable. There are already many soldiers from our armed forces, who volunteer with their own projects for rifles, pistols, and SMG’s. It won’t be easy, but we now have a chance to arm our forces with best guns ever made in Griffonia."
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quantity:0 "Scramble for Every Possible Gun"
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quantity_desc:0 "Our recent experiments with modifactions of old guns have prooved to be quite fruitful, we even managed to convert some muskets into bolt-action rifles, *somehow*. This only proves that if we would set ourselves on that path, we probably could arm even every citizen. And now, with new gun-workshops set in place, we can make sure that even if we run out of the old guns, we can create new ones."
 FAT_arty:0 "Modernize Artillery Guns"
 FAT_arty_desc:0 "Now that our troops are properly equipped with rifles, we need to turn our attention towards bigger caliber artillery guns, if we would use the experience we had gathered while working on the carbines, it's quite possible we would be able to greatly improve our current design."
 FAT_sup:0 "Reorganize Support Units"
 FAT_sup_desc:0 "While soldiers with guns are the main force in the army, units that provide them with medical care, take care of equipment, or make communication possible, are equally important. Yet they had been constantly overlooked in our doctrine, today, there has come a day to change that, and from now on, we will streamline their command chain, and make sure that the specialists are ready for their assignments."
 FAT_magic_equip:0 "Magi-tek Rifles"
 FAT_magic_equip_desc:0 "Using magical crystals, we are able to create an entirely new kind of a gun, one that isn't using ballistic energy, but magic instead. Such guns might revolutionize the very nature of warfare. Besides, seeing how we even have many of the crystals used to power them, it would be ignorant not to use that. But most importantly, if we would enchant our current design, we could effortlessly create a better version of it."
 FAT_motorized_equip:0 "Mechanize our Army"
 FAT_motorized_equip_desc:0 "While using trucks has proven itself to be a good choice, they have also shown themselves to be very easy to damage and destroy by enemy fire, and if such trucks malfunctions, it can turn into a deathtrap for our soldiers. As such, we should now focus on slapping as much armor, and maybe even a gun on the trucks, and turn them into a moving fire positions, that can provide cover and supporting fire to our troopers."
 FAT_tanks:0 "Beats of Steel and Fire"
 FAT_tanks_desc:0 "Tanks have become one of the deciding machines on current battlefields, these great monsters made of steel can overcome truly amazing distances in a few days, can destroy most of fortifications with their guns, while being nearly impenetrable themselves. We should send our agents to nations that already use them, so we could get at least one or two, and reverse engineer them."

 griffonRepublic.0.t:0 "Griffonian Republic."
 griffonRepublic.0.a:0 "Our Republic has not yet been lost."
 griffonRepublic.0.d:0 "The Griffonian Republic was born in the chaotic year 978, when the common people had had enough of being used by debauch and corrupted nobility. After that, we assumed power over all of Griffonia, although sadly, the local nobility and oligarchs were doing everything they could to undermine our new regime. With the Kingdom of Wingbardy and Aquileia leaving the Republic, many more nobles followed them, launching a counter-revolution and forcing us to withdrawl here, to the cold north.\n\nBut all hope for the Republic is not yet lost. While the past few years haven't been easy for us, the time has come to finally reform our state, to give every single griffon, pony, and other creatures, that which had been taken from away from them so long ago. A voice, and the right to determine their own fates."
 griffonRepublic.2.t:0 "Griffonian Republic has invited us to the Republican Pact"
 griffonRepublic.2.d:0 "We have been invited by the Griffonian Republic to join the so called Republican Pact. They want for our countries to support each-other with extensive economic, military, and technological help. But they also would agree only to mutual guarantees in case of other nations aggression."
 griffonRepublic.2.a:0 "Yes, we will join Griffonian Republic in all of their struggles."
 griffonRepublic.1.b.tp:0 "Yes, we will join them, but we want only their guarantee."
 griffonRepublic.2.b:0 "Yes, we will join them, but we want only their guarantee."
 griffonRepublic.2.c:0 "No, we are more then good on our own."
 griffonRepublic.6.t:0 "A pretender state has joined our Faction!"
 griffonRepublic.6.d:0 "We just had got confirmation from one of the pretender states, they officially agreed to join our faction!"
 griffonRepublic.6.a:0 "Great!"
 griffonRepublic.66.t:0 "A pretender state has decided to join Republican Pact."
 griffonRepublic.66.d:0 "One of the pretender states has decided that it would be in their best interest to join our pact, but they seemingly don't want to engage with us and other nations too much, and as such, we only exchanged mutual guarantees."
 griffonRepublic.7.t:0 "A pretender state has disagreed to join our faction, not even joining the Republican Pact."
 griffonRepublic.7.d:0 "It seems that one of pretender state we had invited, has refused to join our struggle, as we had just received confirmation that they don't wish to partake in our projects..."
 griffonRepublic.7.a:0 "Such a Shame."
 griffonRepublic.3.t:0 "Republican Struggle."
 griffonRepublic.3.d:0 "Since we have parted ways with the Griffonian Republic, many years had passed, and our cause of socialism and equality for everyone in Griffonia haven't progressed at all. Now we have to ask ourselves, is it really worth it to keep our current status, and our current coldness towards Republic, if they might be the only real hope for bringing the equality and democracy to every-creature in Griffonia?"
 griffonRepublic.3.a:0 "We will aid the Republic as a partner."
 griffonRepublic.3.b:0 "We need to reapproach Republic authorities, and aid them however we can."
 griffonRepublic.3.c:0 "No, Kemerskai is the same kind of tyrant that we have vowed to fight against in 978."
 griffonRepublic.8.t:0 "[SRS.GetName] agreed to join our faction! "
 griffonRepublic.8.d:0 "Our common-folk from [SRS.GetName] have agreed to join us in a faction, in order to help our common cause of equality, and fairness. This marks the first time when we managed to 'take' back territory we had lost, and we even have managed to do so without firing a single bullet."
 griffonRepublic.8.a:0 "We can be only glad that we managed to solve issue of our split without shedding any blood."
 griffonRepublic.88.t:0 "[SRS.GetName] had officially decided to submit their country to us! "
 griffonRepublic.88.d:0 "In truly unexpected fashion, [SRS.GetName] has sent us a diplomatic note saying that they wish to help us however they can in establishing a better country for every-creature in Griffonia, and that they wish to even submit their state apparatus to us, just to help us with that goal."
 griffonRepublic.9.t:0 "As could have been expected, [SRS.GetName] has refused to deal with us."
 griffonRepublic.9.d:0 " They only sent us a note, saying how we are no better then the rest of the states in Griffonia, and that only they can bring justice to everyone in Griffonia, and that they will do so, without our help."
 griffonRepublic.9.a:0 "That was to be expected, Socialists never have been the most logical bunch..."
 griffonRepublic.10.t:0 "Unrest on the Rise"
 griffonRepublic.10.d:0 "It seems that thanks to some small-scale skirmish, scandal, plot, or whatever else that public like to focus on, there has been a chain reaction of a worrying sort. We are lacking power, citizens are protesting, soldiers are quite grumpy about following our orders. And most importantly of all, every kind of enemy of our republic in our borders is activating, royalists, communists, fascists, there are many of them, and they want to use this situation to their benefit."
 griffonRepublic.10.a:0 "We should ignore it, this wave of popular unrest, will eventually die down."
 griffonRepublic.10.b:0 "Arrest all the troublemakers, and do everything in order to keep our country stable."
 griffonRepublic.11.t:0 "Soldiers are refusing our orders!"
 griffonRepublic.11.d:0 "Today our crisis might have greatly worsened. We don't quite know what caused it, but as of now, our soldiers are refusing to accept even basic orders from us. This has happened only a few times in our recent history, and never ended in a good way for us. It would be good to do something with this."
 griffonRepublic.11.a:0 "Let them rebel for a while, and sooner or later, they will return to us, begging for our help."
 griffonRepublic.11.b:0 "Send our most loyal units to take care of the worst offenders."
 griffonRepublic.12.t:0 "Standing on the edge of the abyss."
 griffonRepublic.12.d:0 "We are on the brink of the collapse, the soldier's mutiny has spread... everywhere, every government institution had somewhat rebelled, even our mail carriers are arming themselves, we need to do something, either we are risking a high threat of coup or a civil war breaking out. And most importantly of all, we have to hunt down the most active foreign and domestic enemies of the republic in our borders."
 griffonRepublic.12.a:0 "We cannot kill our own citizens, we have to negotiating with the rebels."
 griffonRepublic.12.b:0 "Organize our most loyal units and send them to execute all responsible for this."
 griffonRepublic.13.t:0 "Civil War"
 griffonRepublic.13.d:0 "All mutineers, deserters, and protesters have gathered up under command of our few old generals. They demand many things, but they are held together by one thing, absolute hatred towards our republic and our leader. They have attempted to launch a coup in our capital, but their units were beaten back by all the loyalists we had managed to gather. But they won't surrender now, we have to fight them, and kill them all, only through such a show of strength can we hope to show our population that we aren't a failed state."
 griffonRepublic.13.a:0 "Send orders to the army, and install emergency powers. If they want a civil war, they will get it."
 griffonRepublic.18.t:0 "General Rosewing Expedition"
 griffonRepublic.18.d:0 "General Rosewing is one of most prominent warlords in the Republic, yet at same time, his troops and his mandate are supported by our government Yet he only seems to act more independently every day, lately his forces even have been raiding local encampments of troops loyal to us. We cannot let Rosewing grow stronger. We either need to bring Rosewing and his griffons under our control, or make sure they are dealt with."
 griffonRepublic.18.a:0 "Organize our most loyal soldiers, equip them, and send them to bring Rosewing back under our command, or to deal with him appropriately."
 griffonRepublic.19.t:0 "Rosewing Rebelion"
 griffonRepublic.19.d:0 "General Rosewing refused to submit to our forces, as soon as they managed to give him our demands, they were fired on. In the skirmish that ensured we have lost around thirty griffons, while the enemy has lost around fifteen. Our forces have retreated and informed us about the situation. We are currently mobilizing all of our loyal warlords, militias, and soldiers we have in the area. We will hunt Rosewing and his thugs down, and we will show them why they shouldn't dare to shoot even a single bullet at Republican forces."
 griffonRepublic.19.a:0 "Local units won't be enough, mobilize the entire Army of the Republic."
 griffonRepublic.199.t:0 "Rosewing submits to authority of the Republic."
 griffonRepublic.199.d:0 "Surprisingly enough, Rosewing claimed that he didn't know about the raids, and that his recent independent actions were caused by miscommunication and insubordination of his soldiers. He promised to us that he will punish everyone responsible, and make sure this never occurs again. But what is more important then this suspicious story is the fact that he had agreed on submitting to our authority, and even change most of his staff and officers, onto the kind that would be more loyal to us."
 griffonRepublic.199:0   "Seems that Rosewing won't be making any troubles for us, at least for time-being."
 griffonRepublic.198.t:0 "Successful apprehension of Rosewing."
 griffonRepublic.198.d:0 "General Rosewing has been arrested, reports that we got from the field are not too clear, but it seems that as soon as our troopers approached his quarters, they were fired on. After a short exchange of fire, that left few of our soldiers wounded and dead, they had managed to storm their defenses, and as soon as that has happened, all of Rosewing soldiers, with him included, had mass-capitulated to our forces."
 griffonRepublic.198:0  "Good, we have to make sure that Rosewing trial will be as public as possible, we need to show every warlord what happens when they go against The Republic."
 griffonRepublic.20.t:0 "Banditry in the countryside is being dealt with"
 griffonRepublic.20.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of our Republic, bandits, marauders, and other criminals were a true problem for everyone not living in the middle of a big city, many years had passed since, but they had stayed a strong thorn against our government. But that has recently changed, as we now put more of our attention on bringing them down, and we can at least guarantee that major roads and communication paths are safe from them. Yet we cannot stop now, there are still smaller and bigger villages and cities being terrorized by them, and many of smaller roads are still infested with that pest."
 griffonRepublic.20.a:0 "Intensify our efforts, make sure that every road, and every city in the Republic is safe."
 griffonRepublic.21.t:0 "Banditry in the countryside has been dealt with"
 griffonRepublic.21.d:0 "Today marks the first day when no city in our Republic, nor a road, is taken over by bandits. Our campaign to eradicate them was hard and bloody, but it has payed off in the end, and most of our citizens can now sleep soundly, as we made sure that remaments of once great gangs, bands, and groups had been driven into hiding. But we cannot make a mistake here, even though they hide in forests, and in less scrupulous parts of our cities, they could still return to their old ways if we won't push them even harder."
 griffonRepublic.21.a:0 "Make sure that army scouts every single Forest or hiding hole in the countryside."
 griffonRepublic.22.t:0 "Criminal elements have been purged from our country."
 griffonRepublic.22.d:0 "We just got report in, our armed forces have managed to find and swiftly deliver justice to the last band of 'Priesthood' gang. It's quite an interesting end to our campaign, seeing how 'Priesthood' was the first criminal organization in the Republic. With their end, an age in the history of our country ends. Where once was lawlesness, now there is order, where once every well meaning griff was afraid to go out at night, now you can meet all kinds of merry griffons celebrating whatever occasion, or just having fun together, where once most of the roads had to be traveled together with armed escort, now you can see lone mothers with children going on about their day, more then sure about their safety."
 griffonRepublic.22.a:0 "Truly, what we had achieved today, will make the lifes of every one of our citizens better."
 griffonRepublic.42.t:0 "Reports of starvation and famine in countryside..."
 griffonRepublic.42.d:0 "Today some truly terrifying reports have reached Cloudbury. It seems that some of smaller villages, and cities are reporting that they aren't getting enough of food delivered to them. It's nothing that surprising considering that our countryside is in chaos, but if we won't be able to fix that, this could lead to some truly worrying consequences."
 griffonRepublic.42.a:0 "Make sure that reports reaching us are true, and this this isn't some overreaction."
 griffonRepublic.43.t:0 "Reports of hundreds dying, and many thousands starving"
 griffonRepublic.43.d:0 "The Situation in the countryside is bone-chilling, as it seems that previous reports weren't overblown, and were true. What is worse, at this point most of the farmers and places that produce food either keep it for themselves, or sell it privately at greatly inflated prices. And any transports of food are already at great risk of being raided by greedy bandits, or just by starving and desperate griffons. If we wish not to have a catastrophe in our Republic, we should do something."
 griffonRepublic.43.a:0 "Send armed guards together with transports, inspect every mill and every farm for suspicious surplus of food."
 griffonRepublic.44.t:0 "Famine is getting better"
 griffonRepublic.44.d:0 "Since the start of our efforts aimed at stopping, and making the famine less deadly, we have managed to help countless griffons, and to keep many more from dying. While situation isn't perfect now, more and more farms and mills are returning to their usual production quotas. But it will still take time before we can safely let things run on their own, especially since there is still few places where hunger is a very real danger to everyone."
 griffonRepublic.44.a:0 "Focus on making everything returning to work as normal."
 griffonRepublic.45.t:0 "Famine has ended."
 griffonRepublic.45.d:0 "Today marks the day when the Famine has ended, and our food supply is as good as never before. It wasn't easy, and we sadly have to count death in thousands, but this must serve as a warning to us all, that we shouldn't let ever again for such chaos to run wild among in countryside. And as such, our policies of soldiers escorting supply trains, and that of inspections, are here to stay."
 griffonRepublic.45.a:0 "Good, if a slight centralization is the biggest price we pay for making sure that today every griff will eat until he is full, so be it."
 griffonRepublic.50.t:0 "Vedina Question"
 griffonRepublic.50.d:0 "Vedina is a monarchy, same sort that we had tried to destroy in the year 978, yet... they are probably the only monarchy on the entire Griffonian continent that cares about every single one of their citizens, and where the king acts as an administrator of the realm, and treats every griff with the same rights, no matter if griff is a nobleman, or a commoner. As such, we have to make a hard decision of our policy towards them. We either let monarchy prosper for now, under a wise and caring king, yet risk yet another tyrant rising in the future. But to make sure that won't happen, we also could invade them, and make sure that monarchy will never be a threat to Vedina people, yet it would be such a shame to fight against such a nice King... "
 griffonRepublic.50.a:0 "Until they are just, they are same as us, even if their leader is named a King."
 griffonRepublic.50.b:0 "Sometimes, we have to do things we don't like, and we just have to make sure that the threat of monarchy will be destroyed."
 griffonRepublic.51.t:0 "We have been invited to a faction by [FAT.GetName]"
 griffonRepublic.51.d:0 "Today we had been invited to a common faction by [FAT.GetName], they are a republican break-away state from the Griffonian Empire. And they are one of not many nations around us who really gives a damn about the griffons they rule, even if their management isn't the most efficient one. We should take note however, that they are republican to the very depth of their hearts, and as such, if we would refuse, it could anger them into doing something unwise. Yet, at same time, agreeing to getting a common faction with them, while beneficial to commonfolk, could drag us into a bloody and long war with some of the monarchies around."
 griffonRepublic.51.a:0 "Even if we will fight a war, it is worthy for the Republic."
 griffonRepublic.51.b:0 "We cannot ally with such fanatics as the Republic."
 griffonRepublic.52.t:0 "Vedina has agreed to join us!"
 griffonRepublic.52.d:0 "The wise King of Vedina has agreed to an alliance with us, , citing goodness that we can do for common-folk in both of our countries, and how we are the only nations that care for the wellbeing of our citizens."
 griffonRepublic.52.a:0 "This calls for celebration, we had just meet a first king who isn't a power-hungry despot, and is completely reasonable."
 griffonRepublic.53.t:0 "Vedina has refused to join us..."
 griffonRepublic.53.d:0 "As could have been expected, Vedina has disagreed to join our faction, calling us warmongers, and telling us that we would cause thousands of deaths, just for political gains. As always, these are typical monarchist lies, still, it's a bit disappointing that supposedly such a wise and caring king would not agree to join us. But in the end, all monarchies are the same, and this only further proves it."
 griffonRepublic.53.a:0 "King will always be a king, it seems. But, we will liberate people of Vedina from their tyrant soon enough."
 griffonRepublic.54.t:0 "[FAT.GetName] demands our integration into the Republic."
 griffonRepublic.54.d:0 "After [FAT.GetName] had defeated Griffon Empire, and now they are demanding for every state in Griffonia to join their republic. If we would do that, we would have to say goodbye to any of our independence, but otherwise... we might be risking war with The Republic, and that could be very dangerous, or very bloody."
 griffonRepublic.54.a:0 "We have no choice to agree."
 griffonRepublic.54.b:0 "We won't give our independence away to some silly republican pretenders."
 griffonRepublic.55.t:0 "Pretender-state has agreed to peacefully integrate into a republic member state."
 griffonRepublic.55.d:0 "One of the many pretender-state that was born out of the ineptness of the empire has agreed to join us as a republic member state, we give them right to limited autonomy, and having their own elected leaders, but they are our allies and stand together with us when it comes to: Foregin Policy, Military, Science, and Economy. "
 griffonRepublic.55.a:0 "Very good, one potential tyrannical dictatorship less."
 griffonRepublic.56.t:0 "Pretender-state refuses to peacefully integrate."
 griffonRepublic.56.d:0 "One of the pretender-state that has stood with us refuses to bend their knees to us, if we wish to keep our reputation as a major country, and strong player in region, we shouldn't let that go unpunished. "
 griffonRepublic.56.a:0 "Banish them from our faction, they better be glad, we haven't decided to punish them more."
 griffonRepublic.56.b:0 "We need them, for now, but we shall remember this, but as soon as we don't..."
 griffonRepublic.67.t:0 "We have returned to Griffenheim."
 griffonRepublic.67.d:0 "Victory! Finally, our long exile ends, and we are back to where the Republic was born - Griffenheim. Now that city is ours, and resistance has been quelled, we need to decide what kind of a republic we need to be. Should we keep to our previous system, and let be our country be as decentralized as possible? Yet that let us to collapse last time... or should we Centralize, and regulate, and administrate everything from here? Yet, if we would do that, would a common griff still get a true saying in important matters?"
 griffonRepublic.67.a:0 "Idea of decentralized republic is beautiful, yet it only had lead us to a collapse."
 griffonRepublic.67.b:0 "We will stay true to the ideas that led us in 978."
 griffonRepublic.67.c:0 "An alliance of griffon nations"

 griffonRepublic.71.t:0 "Choosing Our Military Doctrine"
 griffonRepublic.71.d:0 "Representatives of many generals, and warlords from our HQ had approached us recently, all of them proposing all kinds of ideas how to reform our armed forces, and in what direction to take them. All of these plans have their pros and cons, but sadly we have to follow one, as it would be simply impossible to keep our armed forces organized otherwise, as such, we have to decide."
 griffonRepublic.71.a:0 "We will have superior organization, and planning: Doctrine of Grand Battle Plan"
 griffonRepublic.71.b:0 "We will drown enemy in our shells, while being safe ourselves: Doctrine of Firepower"
 griffonRepublic.71.c:0 "We will engage every griff from our nation in our great struggle: Doctrine of mass assault"
 griffonRepublic.80.t:0 "Republican Pact calls us to it's aid"
 griffonRepublic.80.d:0 "News just arrived, [GRI.GetName] has attacked one of the Republican Pact members, if we would be to honor the pact, we are supposed to join them in struggle against the Empire. Yet.. empire is quite strong, and while it wouldn't be most honorable, or a nice decision to ignore the pact... it maybe would be for the better?    "
 griffonRepublic.80.a:0 "No, we will honor the pact, and attack the Imperial aggressors."
 griffonRepublic.80.b:0 "Yes... empire is too strong for us to hope to win with it."
 griffonRepublic.90.t:0 "Question about supporting The Griffonian Republic."
 griffonRepublic.90.d:0 "Griffonian Empire has been a warmongering and very aggressive nation before it's collapse to inner debauchery. After one of many revolts, some of the commoners took power there, and established a Republic, that republic haven't lasted for more then a year before being overthrown in a counter-revolution. Remaments of that republic escaped to the north, bide their time, and recently rebuild their forces. Now they are at war with the Griffonian Empire, and the question arises, should we support them in their fight? They are a nation that isn't so far from our concept of harmony, and they truly care for every citizen, but should we support them? "
 griffonRepublic.90.a:0 "Send them equipment and make sure it is known that we look at them as nation in charge of Griffonia."
 griffonRepublic.90.b:0 "Send them all manners of equipment, mostly guns, make sure our support is rather secret then open."
 griffonRepublic.90.c:0 "Recognize them diplomatically as the nation having over-lordship over all Grffonia."
 griffonRepublic.90.e:0 "We cannot engage ourselves in such a conflict."
 griffonRepublic.91.t:0 "Equestrian Help"
 griffonRepublic.91.d:0 "Equestrian Diplomats have given us a note written by Princesses themselves, how they view our state as rightful ruler of all griffonia. In a token of help, they had also send us their equipment, that being mostly guns."
 griffonRepublic.91.a:0 "It seems that not all monarchies are that bad... or at least not griffon monarchies."
 griffonRepublic.92.t:0 "Equestrian Equipment"
 griffonRepublic.92.d:0 "Equestrian Spies and agents in Griffonia had contacted us and let us know that while Princesses approve of our cause, they aren't willing to publicly state it, but as a gift to us, they had sent us many guns."
 griffonRepublic.92.a:0 "They might be a monarchy, but these guns are greatly appreciated."
 griffonRepublic.93.t:0 "Equestrian Approval"
 griffonRepublic.93.d:0 "Equestria had send us diplomatic note, approving of our struggle against the imperialist Griffonian Empire, and saying that we are the rightful overlords of lands currently held by Empire, sadly, we haven't been given any material help by them, as note was saying that it hopes that we will manage to find peaceful solution to our current problem."
 griffonRepublic.93.a:0 "If they really approve of our struggle so much, why they haven't gave us guns? But well, just this note will be useful."
 griffonRepublic.94.t:0 "Equestrian Silence"
 griffonRepublic.94.d:0 "Since the start of our conflict with the Empire, nation of Equestria has been usually silent about it, as far as we know, they haven't stated about their support, or given empire equipment, but they also haven't done any of that to us."
 griffonRepublic.94.a:0 "Monarchies are always the same, no matter if they are griffonian or pony."

 griffonRepublic.60.t:0 "The invention of Beaklle"
 griffonRepublic.60.d:0 "From a rundown suburb of our fair capital comes an invention which will change the lives of many. A simple school griffon has come up with a completely new way of writing down griffonian using new methods of printing. The method involves printing repeating patterns of dots onto paper, yet these dots do not use any ink at all. The new printer pushes small bumps into the paper. What use is this? Well, up until now the blind have been unable to read. Yet the inventor, who is blind himself, professes this new technique allows blind griffons to read. The invention has taken the educaton establishment by storm and two different schools for the blind have just opened in our capital."
 griffonRepublic.60.a:0 "The blind can read. Good for them!"

 griffonRepublic.61.t:0 "It comes from the lake"
 griffonRepublic.61.d:0 "Reports have come in of a strange sighting from Lake Fenfir. Apparently a group of local youths were having a party at the edge of the lake when a black figure rose from the depths of the waters. They alledge to have been attacked, and while authorities have officially disregarded the incident as just some teenagers experimenting with hallucinagens, sightings of the creature have increased. In fact, it's become a bit of a tourist attraction. Any concrete evidence of the creature's existance however has not been found."
 griffonRepublic.61.a:0 "Someone will make money out of this"

 griffonRepublic.62.t:0 "The Perfeatherain Affair"
 griffonRepublic.62.d:0 "Scandal shook the parliment today as it was heard that the secretary of defence, Jaxon Perfeatherain, was involved in an affair with a prostitute. If this wasn't embarassing enough, the prostitute in question, Cataleene Chickela was reportedly also sleeping with another griffon who just so happens to be a known spy for the Communist Revolution Front! Fears that state secrets may have been revealed to Ms Chickela and then passed on through pillowtalk have resulted in calls for the defence secretary to resign, pending further inquiry of ill conduct. Jaxon Perfeatherain denies any claims of ill conduct, but has tendered his resignation to the president. In his leaving speech from the senate, he regretted the loss of confidence in him and spoke of a desire to spend more time with family."
 griffonRepublic.62.a:0 "How embarassing!"

 griffonRepublic.63.t:0 "Only 500 Homes?"
 griffonRepublic.63.d:0 "This week has been marred with controversy as Secretary of Housing Tarold Wingwillian made a spectacular blunder in his address to the senate. Somehow his personal assistant had mistyped his speech and missed two entire zeros on the end of a number. Thus, instead of winning national support for our new housing project to build fifty thousand homes, the government has been belittled and ridiculed for pledging only to build five hundred homes. Worse, the Secretary of Housing did not notice the mistake and was thoroughly quizzed on it by the opposition."
 griffonRepublic.63.a:0 "Get your act together man"

 griffonRepublic.64.t:0 "The GRS Imperitive"
 griffonRepublic.64.d:0 "One of our newest destroyer models has yesterday gone missing after failing to report in while on maneuvers. After realising the destroyer was lost, our naval group was scrambled to search for the vessel. After a full twelve hours of fruitless searching, the destroyer appeared again, gliding out of thick fog. It was first thought the report was a fake as the position of the destroyer was well out of the area that it could have possibly traveled in that time, yet there it was. Even stranger, it was discovered afterwards that the destroyer was completely unmanned on arrival. The entire crew has been reported missing and the ship has been quarantined for further scientific and magical analysis."
 griffonRepublic.64.a:0 "It's a ghost ship you say?"

 griffonRepublic.65.t:0 "The Puritan Liberation Movement"
 griffonRepublic.65.d:0 "A counter culture has been gaining momentum today, opposed to radical changes in our very society. The Puritan Liberation Movement, as they style themselves, advocates that modern society is too lax about more adult subjects such as sex and relationships. Specifically, they are very concerned about the effect that profanity and violence could be having on the younger generations and advocate for some government controls and censorship of the media to protect those who are more sensitive. Their claims are being investigated by the media regulators, but intervention by central government is not planned as of yet."
 griffonRepublic.65.a:0 "Too much blood and guts for some"
