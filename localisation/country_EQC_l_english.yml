 mareland.1.d:0 "The War is turning rapidly in favour of the Changeling Empire. Further resistance is always possible, of course, but at this point, we must consider the possibility of seeking a seperate piece with the Changelings."
 mareland.1.a:0 "We must save ourselves."
 mareland.1.b:0 "We shall never give up on our fellow ponies!"

 mareland.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Seeks a White Peace"
 mareland.2.d:0 "Seeing the the circumstances of the war slowly turning against them, the Ponies in New Mareland wish to sign a seperate peace with us, in order to preserve their sovereignty. This would of course end the war with them much earlier than expected, and allow us to focus our attention to other matters. But we can hardly let them weasel out with a white peace, can we?"
 mareland.2.a:0 "They can have peace, for now."

 mareland.3.d:0 "This morning, we have received a communique from the Changeling Empire, in response to our offer of a seperate peace.\nIt seems that it was wishful thinking to hope that this request would be granted.

 mareland.5.d:0 "Just before dawn, an explosion echoed through Sunset. The source was a toaster factory at the edge of the city. Firefighters worked through the day to tackle the blaze but that didn't stop the police from beginning their investigations. It was indeed sabotage, and it wasn't long until the culprits where identified. Hours after the blast, a letter appeared on the desk of the New Mareland Chronicler's chief editor. It was from a group that called themselves the United Griffon Freedom Front, although the name White Claw Bandits has already been popularised by the tabloids.\n\nThese bandits claim that they object to the forced conscription of griffons into New Mareland's armies with the justification that they want no part in a pony's war and that it is in breach of the Native Freedoms Act of 912.\n\nJustified or not, these criminals have sworn to strike again and there is no knowing when they will stop."
 mareland.5.a:0 "We must bring them to justice!"

 mareland.6.t:0 "Ally with Griffons"
 mareland.6.d:0 "There are many Griffon states who share our communist ideas. But, sadly, they are divided and believe in spreading Communism in their own ways. We have chosen to seek friendship with one of these states, but in doing so we will unfortunately upset the others.\n\nWe must choose wisely, for the future of both New Mareland and the World Revolution is at stake."

This raised some acknowledgment among the greater public due to the humiliating 'defeat' the New Mareland Army Corps suffered in what the media dubbed 'the Cockatrice War'.

It was only after communications with forward groups were terminated that whole groups of Marelander troops were discovered to be turned to stone. It was only through this that the threat Cockatrices posed were fully realized and heavier Divisions were called in to treat these natural menaces like proper threats.\n\nWhile some causalities were suffered the families of those lost to a stony death have been properly compensated and their fates fed to the masses by the free media.

These problems were blamed on lack of infrastructure initially but when search and rescue teams were sent out they too were soon to be lost as well.\n\nBy the time proper army Divisions were assigned to the task Cockatrice hordes and nests had already become accustomed to targeting ponies and due to such dispatched troops were placed under heavy and ruthless assault by these monster birds.\n\nThe cockatrice has successfully routed our forces and we shall need to regroup and properly address this threat if we are to save face once the free media leaks this to the population..."
