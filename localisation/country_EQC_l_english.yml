It was from a group that called themselves the United Griffon Freedom Front, although the name White Claw Bandits has already been popularised by the tabloids.\n\nThese bandits claim that they object to the forced conscription of griffons into New Mareland's armies with the justification that they want no part in a pony's war and that it is in breach of the Native Freedoms Act of 912.\n\nJustified or not, these criminals have sworn to strike again and there is no knowing when they will stop."

Since then, years of immigration, colonisation and one-sided trade deals have resulted in the Commonwealth of New Mareland.\n\nWhile nominally still a part of Equestria, New Mareland has its own government in the Commonwelth Congress and is subject to its own laws and regulations. This de facto independence has led to many New Marelanders wishing to officially separate from Equestria and forge their own path ahead. The poor economic situation has not helped the matter.\n\nWhen the Griffon Empire fell, so did New Mareland's number one trade partner. The situation worsened when on the 29th October 999, the New Manehattan stock market crashed in what has become known as Black Wednesday. Equestria's lack of action in helping resolve the Great Depression that followed has caused resentment in many.\n\nThe times are changing, and New Mareland's future is uncertain.
