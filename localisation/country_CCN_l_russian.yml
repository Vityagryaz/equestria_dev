CCN_Jet_Strategic_Bomber_desc:0 "Not only could cargo and freight make use of a large aircraft that can carry heavier loads, but the power of the jet engine would allow us to carry heavier bombloads."
CCN_defend_the_north:0 "Северная оборонительная линия"
CCN_defend_the_north_desc:0 "Despite our desires to be peaceful and share friendship, other nations are unpredictable. If the North were to fall, our enemy would not only control our coast, but be one step closer to Vesalipolis."
CCN_central_hives:0 "Центральная оборонительная линия"
CCN_central_hives_desc:0 "Ensuring that our capital is a suitable area to fall back to and hold will give us an edge against any hypothetical foe."
CCN_defend_the_south:0 "Южная оборонительная линия"
CCN_defend_the_south_desc:0 "While the ponies of Equestria helped King Thorax learn the magic of friendship, as of late the situation in Equestria has become uncertain. A backup plan may be required."
CCN_fortress:0 "Укрепрайон в Везалиполисе"
CCN_fortress_desc:0 "While Vesalipolis is already heavily defended, the loss of the heart of our hives would result in our downfall, and we might not bounce back this time."
CCN_Changeling_Naval_Supremacy:0 "Новый опыт"
CCN_Changeling_Naval_Supremacy_desc:0 "If there was a navy before the civil war, Chrysalis and those still loyal to her scuttled it before we could take it. As a result, we'll have to purchase spare ships from our neighbors."
CCN_carrier_navy:0 "Тактика авианосцев"
CCN_carrier_navy_desc:0 "A focus on carriers, and naval air warfare, will ensure that even the heaviest armoured ship will no longer be a threat."
CCN_battleship_navy:0 "Сфокусироваться на линкорах"
CCN_battleship_navy_desc:0 "Battleships embody the same things a changeling does. A heavily armoured fighting force that's not to be reckoned with."
CCN_submarine_effort:0 "Разработать субмарины"
CCN_submarine_effort_desc:0 "All forms of navy benefit from submarines. Not only can they strike slow, lumbering ships, but they can be used to raid enemy convoys and keep their troops from being supplied."
CCN_Naval_Bomber:0 "Торпедоносцы"
CCN_Naval_Bomber_desc:0 "Naval Torpedo Bombers, when used properly, have the potential to not only sink a ship, but sink an entire hostile fleet. Ensuring we've got the best naval fighters will give us a great advantage."
CCN_Navy_Doctrine:0 "Разработать новую доктрину"
CCN_Navy_Doctrine_desc:0 "Without the proper doctrine to support them, no ship is capable of doing its job correctly. Developing better naval theory is paramount."

CCN_Light_Cruisers:0 "Новые крейсеры"

CCN_Escort_Carriers:0 "Новые корабли сопровождения"
CCN_Escort_Carriers_desc:0 "While not as large as fleet carriers, escort carriers are useful for ensuring that our smaller fleets have naval air power to back them up, no matter the situation."
CCN_Carriers:0 "Современные авианосцы"
CCN_Carriers_desc:0 "Bigger carriers with more deck space is the omega, the end, of the carrier development. Such a ship would be the epitome of naval warfare."
CCN_Heavy_Cruisers:0 "Тяжелый крейсер"
CCN_Heavy_Cruisers_desc:0 "Battleships, while no doubt impressive, still need support from their smaller sisters. Heavy cruisers not only provide anti-air support, but also bring main armament to match the might of the battleship."
CCN_Battlecruisers:0 "Современные крейсера"
CCN_Battlecruisers_desc:0 "Even with the impressive combination of firepower from both heavy cruisers and battleships, there still needs to be something in the middle to fill the place of either of the other two if they are otherwise unavailable. A Battlecruiser."
CCN_Battleships:0 "Новые линкоры"
CCN_Battleships_desc:0 "The final form of the battleship is the image most imagine. Heavy armor, huge guns, and with enough size to send any lesser enemy retreating back to their home port."
CCN_Marine_Operations:0 "Морской десант"
CCN_Marine_Operations_desc:0 "The development of amphibious troops designed to attack enemies where no land path is possible is something that should be focused on, as the advantage it would deliver is beyond immeasurable."
CCN_Swarms_In_The_Sky:0 "Небесный рой"
CCN_Swarms_In_The_Sky_desc:0 "Filling the skies fighters from both the Air Force and the Naval Air Force will guarantee our victory, as no hostiles planes will remain up to strike us."
CCN_Bomber_Command:0 "Единый воздушный центр"
CCN_Bomber_Command_desc:0 "Creating a unit solely for the purpose of directing our bombers will not only increase effectiveness of communications, but guarantee the right targets are struck."

thoraxian.1.t:0 "The Thoraxian Betrayal"
thoraxian.1.d:0 "With supporters for harmony and friendship growing larger and larger within the hives scattered across changeling lands, it was only time before those upstarts thought themselves too good for the strength and unity of the Queen. Thorax and his supporters, as well as numerous detractors of Chrysalis, have all united under the banner of 'harmony'.\n\nNumerous hives in Volistad, Antax, and Soryth have pledged their allegiance to Thorax, embracing the values of harmony, friendship, and peace."
thoraxian.1.a:0 "We shall embrace harmony!"
thoraxian.1.b:0 "We will come for you soon enough, traitors."

thoraxian.8.d:0 "We have received an offer from the King of the Changelings, he seeks to bring down the Tyrants in the south and promises us a fair share of Equestria if we throw in our support"
thoraxian.8.a:0 "While it pains us to cooperate with bourgeois scum, we accept."
thoraxian.8.b:0 "Why would we work with them they are no better then the tyrant in the south! Refuse their outragous offer."
thoraxian.9.t:0 "Stalliongrad Accepted"
thoraxian.9.d:0 "One more for team Thorax"
thoraxian.9.a:0 "Excellent"
thoraxian.10.t:0 "Stalliongrad Declined"
thoraxian.10.d:0 "Stalliongrad has refused your generous offer and has citied it is a 'doomed endeavour'"
thoraxian.10.a:0 "Maybe Trimmel was right about those communists..." # Someone may feel bad if they killed trimmel at this point?
thoraxian.11.t:0 "Changeling Alliance"

thoraxian.12.t:0 "Yaks Accepted"
thoraxian.12.d:0 "Like they would have missed a good fight"
thoraxian.12.a:0 "Another one for team Thorax"
thoraxian.13.t:0 "Yaks refused."
thoraxian.13.d:0 "The Yaks of Yakyakistan appearently toar apart our treaty after looking it over, its safe to assume they they will not assist us in the upcoming war."

thoraxian.14.d:0 "With the backing of Thorax and his changelings, Queen Velvet has returned from her exile in Equestria, and intends to claim the throne of Olenia as its rightful heir. Supporters of Velvet are already mobilising, and clashing in the streets with those loyal to Johan and his regime.\n\nIt's now up to those fighting to determine the future of Olenia."
thoraxian.14.a:0 "Bah! I'm the rightful ruler of Olenia!"
thoraxian.14.b:0 "The true Queen has returned! Hail Velvet!"
thoraxian.15.t:0 "Marriage Offer"
thoraxian.15.d:0 "After numerous nights together, Thorax and Velvet have grown close over the past few weeks after her successful reinstallation as the rightful monarch of the Kingdom of Olenia, and it was tonight that Thorax proposed to Velvet.

thoraxian.15.b:0 "I refuse, but we can still remain allies"
thoraxian.16.t:0 "Velvet accepted!"
thoraxian.16.d:0 "Velvet was wooed by Thorax's boldness, and agreed to marriage. The ceremony was uneventful, but still celebrated across the two nations with joy from the citizens. Older deer and changeling reacted with suspicion, citing prior rivalry and hatred between the two nations, but those times are over now."
thoraxian.16.a:0 "Till death do us part..."
thoraxian.17.t:0 "Velvet refused but insisted we remain just allies."
thoraxian.17.d:0 "Ouch"
thoraxian.17.a:0 "Oh... okay"
thoraxian.18.t:0 "Capital of the Commonwealth"
thoraxian.18.d:0 "With the unification of Olenia and the Changeling Lands as the Olenian-Changeling Commonwealth, a decision has to be made regarding the capital. While continuing to rule from Vesalipolis is the easiest to justify, considering it's where changelings have ruled from for nearly all time, arguments have to be made for moving the capital to the Olenian capital in Hjortland.\n\nAlternatively, arguments have been made for moving the capital to two of the Olenian and Changeling's biggest cities, Vaverfront and Vraks. While not as significant historically as the two current capitals, moving it to one of the other two may bring a sense of unity to the newly formed commonwealth."

thoraxian.18.c:0 "Vaverfront"
thoraxian.18.e:0 "Vraks"
thoraxian.19.t:0 "Propose Unification"
thoraxian.19.d:0 "With Thorax and Velvet's dynasties united in marriage, Thorax has made a proposal. Just as Thorax and Velvet are united, why not unite Olenia and the Changeling Lands under one flag, one banner, as a diarchal system? Not only will it bring two races who have had conflicts closer together, but it'll help unite the land and bring about more friendship and harmony."
thoraxian.19.a:0 "Olenian-Changeling Commonwealth."
thoraxian.19.b:0 "We should stay seperate countries."
thoraxian.20.t:0 "Velvet refused the Union"
thoraxian.20.d:0 "Despite all that the Changelings and the Deer have been through in recent history, Queen Velvet has regettably declined the offer to unify both the Changeling Lands and the Kingdom of Olenia."
thoraxian.20.a:0 "Oh... okay"
thoraxian.21.t:0 "Keisari Thorax" #IRC everyone is just gonna choose Velvet even myself
thoraxian.21.d:0 "In spite of the years of differences of the two nations, Queen Velvet has decided to unite the Changelings and the Deers as one nation under the diarchal rule of the married duo. As of this moment forward, King Thorax is now Keisari Thorax, and both Olenia and the Changeling Lands are the Olenian-Changeling Commonwealth!"
thoraxian.21.a:0 "Keisarinna Velvet Vepsäläinen!" #remember to change last name if we ever agree on an Olenian Dynasty name in Politburo Psody
thoraxian.21.b:0 "Keisari Thorax Vepsäläinen!" #remember to change last name if we ever agree on an Olenian Dynasty name in Politburo Psody

thoraxian.25.t:0 "Coronation of [CCN.GetLeader]"
thoraxian.25.d:0 "This morning [GetDateText] [CCN.GetLeader] was crowned ruler of the Olenian-Changeling Commonwealth. At the opening of today's thousand-year-old rite the Allsherjorgodi presented [CCN.GetLeader] to the citizens of both countries as their "undoubted Ruler", that is by holy right. Three hours later they went forth from the coronation event, amid the greatest rejoicing, a crowned and consecrated Monarch. No such delight has hailed a Sovereign's Coronation before."
thoraxian.25.a:0 "Intresting..."
thoraxian.29.t:0 "Olenian Civil War Intervention"
thoraxian.29.d:0 "After pledging our own support to Queen Velvet's cause, it's our time to shine, and bring back harmony by helping Velvet to take down Johan. Our forces stand ready, and willing to help Velvet reclaim her rightful place as the harmonious Queen."
