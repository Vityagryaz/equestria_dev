 ### FOCUS ###
 EQC_NLR_reorganise_the_government:0 "Reorganize the Government"
 EQC_NLR_reorganise_the_government_desc:0 "Jet Set has proven himself enough to warrant a second chance at power under her Majesty. His peers meanwhile have not and must be replaced by far more credible citizens of the new Lunar Empire. Many of those are likely to be fellow Thestrials who have long since been cheated out of any position of power previously under Celestia's rule."
 EQC_NLR_emergency_factory_work:0 "Emergency Factory Work"
 EQC_NLR_emergency_factory_work_desc:0 "News has been received detailing the intensifying civil war on the mainland. With this news has come orders to send assistance in the form of equipment and ponypower immediately. In order to fulfill this sudden directive all factories must begin conducting emergency work shifts to keep up with material demands. For the glory of the Lunar Empire and the Eternal Night!"
 EQC_NLR_love_a_bat:0 "Love a bat day"
 EQC_NLR_love_a_bat_desc:0 "With the age of the Thestrial drawing near it has become a requirement to assimilate non-Thestrials. Through intense effort we can convince the Thestrials to exit their self-imposed isolation and herd them into major population centers. Using parades, school activities, and..any other means needed regardless of their nature, we shall add Thestrials to everyday Marelander life...and they'll like it too."
 EQC_NLR_why_fight:0 "Why We Fight"
 EQC_NLR_why_fight_desc:0 "It was only through Luna's guidance that we ever settled down and ceased our hostile nature towards those unlike us. When she was banished we were demoralized and rejected society in spite of our savior's exile. When she returned we reluctantly obeyed her call for peace and inclusion back into Equestria. Again Luna, no...Nightmare Moon has returned and we shall answer her call this time. We will fight for the Night."
 EQC_NLR_defend_home:0 "Defend Our Home"
 EQC_NLR_defend_home_desc:0 "Not only do we now have Celestial supporters in our own ranks and across the sea to worry  about, we also have our Griffin neighbors which aren't trustworthy in the slightest. As such we must prepare our soldiers for the likely time we'll have to defend our homeland as well as construct fortifications where necessary."
 EQC_NLR_invite_bats:0 "Invite Bats"
 EQC_NLR_invite_bats_desc:0 "New Marelander research and development has always lagged behind that our mainland Overlords. Due to our new views on Thestrials we can finally convince the smartest in their number to join our nation's research. Fresh brainpower should do well to help expand our research fields and hopefully close the technological gap we unfortunately share with the Mainland."
 EQC_NLR_infrastructure:0 "Infrastructure Development"
 EQC_NLR_infrastructure_desc:0 "Opposite of our previous Overlord, Lunar authority has voiced interest in expanding New Mareland's pitiful infrastructure. Between the new willingness of Thestrials to help map out their cave systems for transportation and Nightmare Moon's own statements regarding the importance of New Mareland's logistics in the "foreseeable future" has given us the funds to finally improve our network!"
 EQC_NLR_loyalty_to_nightmare_moon:0 "Loyalty to the Moon"
 EQC_NLR_loyalty_to_nightmare_moon_desc:0 ""It is by the Moon's light that I have been given purpose. It is by the guidance of Nightmare Moon that I attain a higher state of being. The night's beauty trumps all without any question, the sun is a horrid object. Is it through Luna's kindness that I am forgiven for my past transgressions and am relieved of the Original Sin in once choosing the Sun over her. In this I bow in obedience to the Lunar Empire.""
 EQC_NLR_mint_new_bits:0 "The New Lunar Currency"
 EQC_NLR_mint_new_bits_desc:0 "The old Celestial bits are effectively worthless due to the ongoing depression and we must begin minting a new and improved Lunar currency as part of our ongoing effort to fix the collapsed economy. Not only will we be helping ourselves but such an act will be warmly received by her Majesty as quite the gesture of loyalty. Anything distancing ourselves from the Celestial past is a good thing at this point."
 EQC_NLR_end_midnight_austerity:0 "End the Midnight Austerity"
 EQC_NLR_end_midnight_austerity_desc:0 "Even before Lunar forces took the helm of New Mareland Austerity had been in full swing for some time. The quality of life for the common New Marelander fell drastically as a result. With our debt quickly fading and the end of the road to recovery in sight the time has finally come to end the Austerity and begin focusing on improving the lives of our citizens once more."
 EQC_NLR_rebuild_the_nation:0 "Rebuild the Nation"
 EQC_NLR_rebuild_the_nation_desc:0 "Even with our current moves to reinvigorate the economy there still lies the fact much of the nation is in shambles and dilapidated. If we're going to fully climb out of this financial sinkhole we're in we'll need widespread reconstruction efforts across major population centers and bring everything up to modern standards. Without this we're not much better than the backwards Griffons just over the border that are spread out across the continent.."
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolts_focus:0 "Shadowbolts"
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolts_focus_desc:0 "The Shadowbolts are an ancient secret society which has held reverence for Nightmare Moon as long as its history has been kept. Unfortunately the immense age of the society has its origins masked in mystery as virtually nopony remembers how or on what beliefs it was founded. Regardless her Majesty has seen fit to allow the New Marelander sect of the Shadowbolts to take the helm of leadership over the colony as a whole."
 EQC_NLR_night_schools:0 "Public Night Schools"
 EQC_NLR_night_schools_desc:0 "The Nocturnal life style of bat ponies were never well respected or seen highly in the eyes of the Celestial Government, thus no public aid was ever given in regard to Thestrial needs such as public school. With Nightmare Moon in control she has seen fit to order the creation of public night schools that will properly teach the next generation of Thestrial kids in comfortable time settings."
 EQC_NLR_united_shadow_works:0 "United Shadow Works"
 EQC_NLR_united_shadow_works_desc:0 "For decades the Shadowbolts have had numerous Industry bigwigs in their ranks. With the arrival of the Eternal Night and Nightmare Moon's ascension to the throne of Canterlot the time has come for the Shadowbolt society's 'Shadow Works' to merge together for the greater good of the Lunar Empire. No more privatization, all most be given for furthering the Empire's cause."
 EQC_NLR_anti-celestia_propaganda:0 "Anti-Celestial Propaganda"
 EQC_NLR_anti-celestia_propaganda_desc:0 "Many New Marelanders do not have any idea how Celestia could ever be seen as bad. Due to this it'll be increasingly difficult to justify suppressing Celestial beliefs unless this is directly address. As such money must be put into a large campaign detailing why Celestia is the Oppressive Tyrant she is!"
 EQC_NLR_moonlight_highways:0 "Moonlit Highways"
 EQC_NLR_moonlight_highways_desc:0 "We do not have the funds to electrically light roads stretching into the rural regions of New Mareland. But at the same time the Moon's light is strong enough now to guide travelers if we clear forestry and other obstructions to keep roads out in the open beneath the Moon's gaze. Effectively citizens will always be able to ravel free of worry upon our major road networks!"
 EQC_NLR_equal_bat_rights:0 "Equal Bat Rights"
 EQC_NLR_equal_bat_rights_desc:0 "While not officially so there was subtle bias towards Equestrians under Celestia. Be this intentional or not Thestrials were not equal to their kin on paper. Nightmare Moon has seen fit to rectify this immediately and now Thestrials are properly equal with non-Thestrials. Secretly so there now carries a bias in favor of Thestrials as well...vengeance is a dish best served cold."
 EQC_NLR_mine_the_bat_caves:0 "Mine the Bat Caves"
 EQC_NLR_mine_the_bat_caves_desc:0 "Bat pony caves are seldom if ever entered by non-Thestrials. Due to this they are rarely ever prospected and any valuable minerals found within have remained untouched for decades. With Thestrials now becoming a part of everyday life their caves have become open for advanced examination to discover and gather much needed raw material for the Industry at large."
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolt_clubs:0 "Shadowbolt Clubs"
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolt_clubs_desc:0 "Now that our secret society isn't so secret anymore we must begin the long process of incorporating the uninitiated into our ranks as loyal members. The best way to begin going about this is creating 'Shadowbolt Clubs' for children who are far more pliable than their parents to our ways. Not only will we indoctrinate the next generation but we shall also remove their consumerist mindset as well."
 EQC_NLR_magic_of_midnight:0 "Magic of Midnight"
 EQC_NLR_magic_of_midnight_desc:0 "We of the Shadowbolt society know full well Thestrials have never been capable of magic much like Unicorns. Yet there is a strange mysticism revolving around the Night whenever Nightmare Moon has risen. Now that this mysticism has been allowed to remain for a prolonged duration the effects of it have become very real. In the shadow of the night we are now unbeatable!"
 EQC_NLR_spread_the_darkness:0 "Spread the Darkness"
 EQC_NLR_spread_the_darkness_desc:0 "Our economy has fully recovered, our military is stronger than ever, and our population is inspired and loyal. With our secured internal stability we can now look beyond our borders to vile Wingbardy and the Karthinian pact that has always been a threat to our sovereignty. A formal request will be sent to Canterlot to invade and spread Lunar supremacy onto these pitiful birds."
 EQC_NLR_embrace_the_night:0 "Embrace the Night"
 EQC_NLR_embrace_the_night_desc:0 "New Mareland has yet to prove itself worthy of self-rule. Bat ponies have always remained as second class citizens to an even larger extreme than that of old Celestial Equestria. General Flawless Glow will be assigned to be Governor-General of New Mareland and take charge of properly shaping it into a colony worthy of the Moon."
 EQC_NLR_open_the_bat_caves:0 "Open the Bat Caves"
 EQC_NLR_open_the_bat_caves_desc:0 "Bat ponies have always been reclusive in their caves to such an extreme that they have their own industry and economy too. I can easily pressure my fellow Thestrials to open the caves fully and merge their industry and economy into the whole of New Mareland's. In the future event of war it'll be useful to have weapons manufactories immune from long range bombing..." 
 EQC_NLR_daytime_curfew:0 "Daytime Curfews"
 EQC_NLR_daytime_curfew_desc:0 "Fact: We Thestrials operate most and best at night due to our nocturnal nature. Fact: Most of New Mareland is active during the day where most of us must rest. Conclusion: Daytime Curfews must be established to help manage the population better and root out partisan forces. Those that insist on staying out in the Sun past Curfew are obviously planning the downfall of the state and must be eliminated as a result."
 EQC_NLR_form_the_bat_pony_corps:0 "Form the Bat Pony Corps"
 EQC_NLR_form_the_bat_pony_corps_desc:0 "Up until now bat ponies have been discouraged and excluded from military service. Despite their natural militaristic nature making them easy recruitment targets the old Celestial Government saw fit to never put weapons into the hooves of those they could not trust and control fully. These are no longer those times! Luna's finest should not be barred from military service any longer..."
 EQC_NLR_horrors_of_the_sun:0 "Horrors of the Sun"
 EQC_NLR_horrors_of_the_sun_desc:0 "I personally understand the horrors of Celestia's baleful sun. However the many citizens of New Mareland, both Thestrial and not are very ignorant to these horrid facts. If I am ever to garner support to strike down that Tyrant of the Sun the population will need to understand why the Sun is so terrible and dangerous!"
 EQC_NLR_a_bat_on_every_corner:0 "A Bat on Every Corner"
 EQC_NLR_a_bat_on_every_corner_desc:0 "If New Marelanders were trustworthy there would've been an active Thestrial minority prior to the ascension of Nightmare Moon. The situation for Thestrials here has been pitiful and none of these none-Thestrials can be trusted! To ensure obedience and loyalty amongst the population a Bat will be placed on every corner and the presence of Nightmare Moon's most loyal subjects shall be felt by all who'd have second thoughts."
 EQC_NLR_midnight_training_department:0 "Midnight Training Department"
 EQC_NLR_midnight_training_department_desc:0 "Bat ponies are adept hunters in the night, this has always been true. However the regular ponies of New Mareland are not proficient night fighters...with this in mind funds shall we set aside to set up large scale training centers purely for the purpose of teaching recruits how to properly fight and move in the dead of night. Regardless of who we recruit our armies will have the home field advantage in the darkness."
 EQC_NLR_figh_great_depression:0 "Fight Great Depression"
 EQC_NLR_figh_great_depression_desc:0 "Much like we fight the Sun and the fools who support it we too must fight against the ongoing economic depression that has plagued New Mareland for years by whatever means necessary. If this means sending her Majesty's subjects to unpaid overtime so be it. They should feel honored to be under the Moon's guidance in the first place. The advancement of the Empire should be enough reward for these cretins."
 EQC_NLR_research_for_the_cause:0 "Research for the Cause"
 EQC_NLR_research_for_the_cause_desc:0 "Upon my arrival here research and development departments were in utter shambles between economic collapse and the rapid change of leadership from Celestial to Lunar control. Now that there is an ongoing war there can be no time for interruptions in the technological field. The brightest Thestrials must be called forth to research for the Moon's righteous cause against the Sun and all those that might stand in the way after."
 EQC_NLR_re-educate-sun-loyalists:0 "Reeducating Celestial Loyalists"
 EQC_NLR_re-educate-sun-loyalists_desc:0 "With Lunar control cemented over New Mareland there still exists many Celestial loyalists and it falls onto us to fix this for the sake of stability. It matters not how this is carried out be it with a whip or within a classroom. There can be no room for disobedience under her Majesty's guiding light and for that these dissidents will perish or be corrected no matter what."
 EQC_NLR_expand_bat_caves:0 "Expand the Bat Caves"
 EQC_NLR_expand_bat_caves_desc:0 "Bat Pony Caves in New Mareland have always been stunted growth-wise due to the relative lack of aid from the former Celestial Government. With this in mind I see no wrong in appropriating land from unreliable non-Thestrials and giving it to Thestrial communities for the sake of their continued growth. Bat pony population growth otherwise is far more important than anything else right now long-term speaking."
 EQC_NLR_recovering_economy:0 "The Recovering Economy"
 EQC_NLR_recovering_economy_desc:0 "Between outright brute-forcing the economy back into shape, establishing full control over the population, and finally ensuring the expedited growth of the next Thestrial generation which has ensured we shall have obedient workers and soldiers in the future, the economy is finally making a full recovery. Before long New Mareland will be in the position to become the jewel of the Lunar Empire it deserves to be."

 ### EVENTS ###
 EQC_NLR.1.t:0 "The Sunset Question"
 EQC_NLR.1.d:0 "We have secured the country at large and the time has come to wipe our territory clean of any vile Celestial titles. Where better to start with than our capital of course! Shall the capital's administration make ready to retitle itself to the proud city of Midnight?"
 EQC_NLR.1.a:0 "May we begin the course of annihilating any traces of the oppressive sun!"
 EQC_NLR.1.b:0 "Keeping the old name is a permanent reminder of our victory."
 
 EQC_NLR.2.t:0 "The Bats Come Out of Hiding"
 EQC_NLR.2.d:0 "As part of a National effort to begin the assimilation of non-Thestrials into Lunar society the so-called "Love a Bat Day" holiday was born. Conceptually speaking it remained difficult to convince formerly isolated and lonesome Bat Pony populations to come out into major population centers for the purpose of exposing themselves. It's fortunate non-Thestrials are easily befriended as the fluffy ears of our brothers and sisters were more than enough to woo the hearts of many ponies. "Love a Bat Day" has been a resounding success across the board, unity amongst our ranks will only improve from here now that Bats and non-Bats alike are commonly around one another."
 EQC_NLR.2.a:0 "Like stealing candy from a filly."
 
 EQC_NLR.3.t:0 "The Direction of our Society"
 EQC_NLR.3.d:0 "We of the Shadowbolt society have always worshipped Nightmare Moon for as long as we can remember. There is no doubt about our loyalties to her Majesty..however we have not always professed such heavy desires to bath the world in Eternal Darkness either. Such a fact has been kept hidden from common Thestrials and her Majesty alike. Now that we have finally been forced out into the open our ideals are also to be squeezed out of us soon enough. Our true thoughts on the matter can be viewed as treason..however our distance from the Mainland may serve us well in being too much a hassle to 'correct' our beliefs. With this in mind it's best if we take our stance now rather than later when her Majesty's attentions are directed heavily elsewhere. We will not get this chance when we are put under a magnifying glass by Canterlot in the coming future.\n\nAt the same time..perhaps it is time for us to update our views and come more in line with her Majesty's points. The concept of Eternal night still strikes fear into many of us but we will brave it for the sake of obedience to the true Goddess. There's no telling what might happen to our society if we don't..."
 EQC_NLR.3.a:0 "We need not soak ourselves in darkness to be followers of the Night. We shall pursue Neutrality."
 EQC_NLR.3.b:0 "The age of the Thestrial has begun, we must embrace the Dark as it has embraced us!"
