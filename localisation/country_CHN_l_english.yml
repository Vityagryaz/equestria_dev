POLITICS_CHRYSALIS_DESC:0 "Hell hath no fury like a Queen scorned. Chrysalis is one of many Changeling Queens across the world, what has always set her apart from others however has been her near exhaustless tenacity and lust for power. Doing what was seen as suicidal by Changeling standards in sieging the Equestrian Capital of Canterlot in 1002 she immediately made a name for herself. The stunt had made her known in the Changeling world but her failure had brought shame and humiliation on her head. After being literally blown off from Canterlot back into Changeling Lands she started from scratch once more and learned from her mistakes. With this knowledge she dominated, killed, and tortured any rival Queen that challenged her authority until finally she reigned supreme as the true 'Queen' of all Changelings...in Equestria at least. It's 1007, 5 years later since that fateful day in Canterlot. Chrysalis has begun to tighten her grip upon Changelingkind and while there's still much left to do her next attempt at conquering Canterlot and then the rest of Equestria is looking far more reachable than ever before..."
POLITICS_DRUSIL_DESC:0 "Drusil is...difficult to describe. Her interests clashed hard with that of her peers but not so much in what is right in the world but rather how one would want to extend their power. Perhaps it'd been Drusil's birthplace that had her interests in the ocean cemented from Nymph-hood. In the end what the blue-haired Changeling had made was the first Hive which could properly say it possessed a navy- in fact that's all Drusil's forces were, the Changeling Realm's finest sailors. She isolated herself from the cutthroat nature of Changeling politics and focused on what made her happy, making ships and sinking ones that Deers made..or the rare times another Hive had tried seafaring. When word of a Changeling Queen's attempt at taking Canterlot had failed she hadn't cared at all, she barely recalling the name of that very same bug when they approached her years later with an enticing offer; become the Grand Admiral of the new United Changeling Navy. Drusil's true loyalties remain unknown as she has thus far been an obedient part of Chrysalis' war machine and had joined her willingly to begin with- but only out of a generous offer. Only time will tell if Drusil's ambitions continue to run parallel to Chrysalis' own..and not directly into them."
POLITICS_NEXUS_DESC:0 "It's a fact Chrysalis has done her best to hide but..a large part of her successes in such a short timeframe was thanks to Queen Nexus. Nexus herself is a spitting image of Chrysalis in nearly every way, both are heavily militaristic, violent, and power hungry. This mindset had Nexus' Hive Vraks rise to power quickly but her young age left her unsure of the future and of her own continued success. When Chrysalis was forcefully sent back to the Changeling Realm her refusal to accept defeat or let her humiliation deter her was quickly noticed by an impressionable Nexus. Nexus had found a superior to be mentored by as their ideals matched. Nexus' request to be mentored served as the biggest boon to Chrysalis' rise as she had the might of a very powerful Hive alongside the remainder of her own shortly after her failure in Canterlot. Now Nexus could very well be seen as the closest Chrysalis has to a daughter and the closest she'll ever have to an heir proper. For Nexus, power makes right..and Chrysalis has only made right since the day they met. She'd see Chrysalis' will be done even if she were to die, that much is certain."
POLITICS_CASCADE_DESC:0 "Cascade is a rare mare in the world. Unlike her peers she professed desire to discover new ideas and concepts as well as accept such. Always looking at things from a different perspective from her peers, this included things such as war and destruction. As a Queen she only managed to thrive by intelligence and political maneuvering as she never had much a stomach to send her children off to die in war. When Chrysalis began her hemolymph-soaked road to power Cascade acknowledged it first and tried her best to work against the rampant Queen's activities. Despite her efforts Chrysalis succeeded nonetheless and she was the last free Changeling Hive to have surrendered to Chrysalis' hegemony. She now exists as a primary source of discontent in Chrysalis' domain and has only been kept alive out of necessity over outright desire. If she is to break free of Chrysalis' grip she will need to play her cards right, otherwise she too might just join the droves of her now dead colleagues..."
POLITICS_TRIMMEL_DESC:0 "Trimmel is an oddity in Changeling politics, not many actually know of his origins very well and only Chrysalis and Nexus properly do. Trimmel himself is nothing more than a regular drone, what set him so far apart from his siblings and cousins was actually his intelligence- combat intellect that is. Most drones who show any sort of martial prowess on the field tend to be specially bred or taught from birth. Trimmel was neither of these things and was born to an incredibly poor Queen. One so powerless that when Chrysalis and Nexus effortlessly decimated Trimmel's hive his Queen had been slain simply for lack of use. Nobody in Trimmel's Hive held a use, they were all viewed as worthless and weak as their Queen had been. Not Trimmel, however...Trimmel, being the scrawny stuntie he was at the time hid away as Nexus and Chrysalis' forces rampaged through his home. Unlike his siblings he chose to not only hide but also lay traps and properly arm himself. When Nexus and Chrysalis inspected the remains of the Hive together they'd find a lone Trimmel among the carcasses of nearly 7 or 9 of the duo's own goons. It was here that Trimmel proved he was something else, that he wasn't entirely without worth. Seeing a tenacity in him that reminded Chrysalis of her own self she gave Trimmel an offer he couldn't refuse- joining Chrysalis' Hive. With this new chance at life Trimmel grasped onto it with both hooves and pushed himself far. By the time Chrysalis had finished consolidating her hold on the Changeling Realm Trimmel had already ascended to being a top General and tactician. Even if he might have to thank Chrysalis for everything done for him..the memory of his home's destruction still remains scarred in his thoughts. For now he is still a soldier and officer, one that is loyal to his benefactor regardless of the past...for now."
POLITICS_HEX_DESC:0 "She watches you, she has always watched you. The Changeling known as Hexperix is by far one of the most demented creatures to have ever lived. She stands to be perhaps the oldest Queen currently alive and with her age has come a forced respect for her by the younger generation. With that respect has also come an openness to the so-called Faith Hexperix has created in claiming to be a divine Prophet who commonly has communion with an otherworldly entity. The mare's insane luck over the decades has caused many drones and Queens to believe there is something stranger than magic going on around Hexperix. For once she'd been the prettiest Changeling in all of the realm, she'd now become a wicked hag of her former self. All in the pursuit of revering 'her' God, the God of 'all' Changelings- The Great Devourer. According to her the Devourer had been the creator of Changelingkind and had chosen Hexperix to be the vessel to which it communicates with its children. Hexperix's influence was strong enough to the point where even Chrysalis could not eliminate her without risking her entire plan. Perhaps Hexperix is right...the time of the Changeling is nigh."
